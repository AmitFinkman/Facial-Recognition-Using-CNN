# Facial-Recognition-Using-CNN

## Overview
This project implements a facial recognition system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for one-shot learning. The goal is to determine whether two facial images of previously unseen persons belong to the same individual. The approach is inspired by the paper "Siamese Neural Networks for One-shot Image Recognition".
Our network (based from thenetwork from the paper) architecture follows the principles of a Siamese Neural
Network, designed for one-shot learning tasks. The network processes two input images in parallel through
shared weights to compute a similarity score indicating whether the images belong to the same person.
